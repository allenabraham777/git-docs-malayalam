## Contributing to the repo

Follow the format used in [official git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs), would be better if same file names are also followed.

For Example:

> If you are planning to add ```config``` command then refer https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config and translate the content to malayalam. The name of the created file will be **git-config.md** (Observe the url for git-config, it ends with git-config hence file name is git-config). 


> Along with creating **git-config.md** you need to modify **index.md** edit the line which contains ```git-config``` to ```[git-config](git-config.md)```

Raise a pull request after adding the contents, I will review and merge the PR.
